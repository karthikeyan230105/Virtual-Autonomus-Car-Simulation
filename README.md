# Virtual-Autonomus-Car-Simulation
This project presents an interactive Car Simulation System that integrates artificial intelligence techniques like Fuzzy Logic, Genetic Algorithm (GA), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for dynamic control and learning. Built using Web technologies and rendered in 3D using Three.js, the system provides users with an immersive car simulation.
